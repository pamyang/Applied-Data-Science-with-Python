# Applied Data Science with Python
This repository is for assignments and projects for the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The specialization is a set of five courses designed to introduce individuals with a python programming background to the data science applications of the language. Examples of covered concepts include use of toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx in order to develop statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques.

The five courses taught are Introduction to Data Science in Python; Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python; Applied Machine Learning in Python; Applied Text Mining in Python; and Applied Social Network Analysis in Python. The first three courses are intended to be taken in succession, while the last two courses can be can be taken in any order.

## Introduction to Data Science in Python
The first course in the specialization starts with the basics of the python programming environment, touching on fundamental techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course primarily focuses on data manipulation and cleaning with the pandas data science library, using the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame data structures for data analysis, alongside effective uese of functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables.

Assignments in this course are designed to teach students how to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.
