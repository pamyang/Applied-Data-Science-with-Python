# Applied Data Science with Python
This repository is for assignments and projects for the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The specialization is a set of sive courses designed to introduce individuals with a python programming background to the data science applications of the language. Examples of covered concepts include use of toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx in order to develop statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques.

The five courses taught are Introduction to Data Science in Python; Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python; Applied Machine Learning in Python; Applied Text Mining in Python; and Applied Social Network Analysis in Python. The first three courses are intended to be taken in succession, while the last two courses can be ordinally interchanged.
