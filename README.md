# Applied Data Science with Python
This repository is for assignments and projects for the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

The five courses taught are Introduction to Data Science in Python; Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python; Applied Machine Learning in Python; Applied Text Mining in Python; and Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

More info about the specialization can be found at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python .

## Introduction to Data Science in Python
The first course in the specialization starts with the basics of the python environment, touching on techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course primarily focuses on data manipulation and cleaning with the pandas data science library, using the Series and DataFrame data structures for data analysis, alongside functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables.

Assignments in this course are designed to teach students how to take tabular data, clean and manipulate it using pandas, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.
